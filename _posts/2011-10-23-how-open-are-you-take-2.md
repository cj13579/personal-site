A long time ago I did a small post called &#8220;How open are you?&#8221; &#8211; you can find it <a href="http://cj13579.dyndns-server.com/site/?p=77" target="_blank">here</a>. This was for an old server which has long since died and been recycled. I thought that it was about time that I revisited this therefore and post an update. <!--more-->Those eagle eyed folk amongst you will notice that I have less that half the packages installed than before. This new box has no GUI and has been streamlined. You will also notice that I have improved in my score from before. I am now 99.9% open although I think I should be 100% because I definitely don&#8217;t remember paying for &#8216;unbar&#8217;, I would never do such a thing.
