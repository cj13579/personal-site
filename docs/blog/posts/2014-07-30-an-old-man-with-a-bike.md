My dad is retiring tomorrow and to celebrate his retirement he has decided that he is going to go on one almighty bike ride! It's taking him to all corners of the UK and is going to take several weeks. So that he can keep a diary of his ride, and so people can keep up with how he is getting on, he has set-up a blog: [www.anoldmanandhisbike.com](http://www.anoldmanandhisbike.com).

If you want to keep up with his ride then feel free to head over there and subscribe to his updates!
