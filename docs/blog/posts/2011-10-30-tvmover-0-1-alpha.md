Over the next few days (or probably weeks) I am going to make a HOW-TO on a super set-up that I have configured on my Ubuntu headless home media server. If you would like to read a little bit more about what the core parts to this are and get a copy of the code then&#8230;<!-- more -->

Here it is! Below are a list of the main programs that are touched as part of this set-up:

TorrentWatch-X: a web based tool to automate downloads of tv shows via torrents and RSS. <http://code.google.com/p/torrentwatch-x/>

Transmission-Daemon: an open source, volunteer-based bit-torrent client. <http://www.transmissionbt.com/>

ssmtp: a program to for forwarding automated email off your machine and to an external email address.

XBMC: an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media player and entertainment hub for digital media

TVMover: my little program to link it all together

If you want to take the code and config files straight away then you can find them [here](http://104.196.105.206/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/tvmover.zip).
