Welcome to the revamped <a title="the new look site" href="http://cj13579.homelinux.org" target="_self">cj13579.homelinux.org</a>! I think that you will agree with me that it is much better than the <a title="The old site" href="http://cj13579.dyndns-server.com/old" target="_self">old</a> one. I have decided that I will put some effort into this one and  (but don't hold me to this) regularly update it.

I don't know what I am going to be writing about yet. I am thinking that it is going to have a technological focus. I will probably use it to showcase some projects that I am either working on or have in the pipeline. Or just stuff that I discover and wish to share with anyone who will care to read it.

Anyway, that's enough from me for now.

Enjoy the site please. That is after all, what it is there for.

Chris
