I have just migrated this blog to my new personal domain name and as part of this refresh I wanted to include Google Analytics to see how many [read: few] people come to my site.<!-- more -->

I use Google Analytics to report on <a href="http://www.anoldmanandhisbike.com" target="_blank">my dad's epic bike trip blog</a> so I am familiar with how it works and how easy it can be to add to a WordPress site.

For my <a href="http://www.anoldmanandhisbike.com" target="_blank">dad's site</a> it was really simple and I used <a href="http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-add-google-analytics-to-wordpress-in-under-60-seconds/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to really simply insert the Google Analytics code into the site's theme. However, for portfolio press it just did not want to work. The answer: the excellent <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers/" target="_blank">insert headers and footers plugin</a>. Simply paste your Google Analytics code into the Footers page on the plugin and your Google Analytics stuff will start working within a couple of minutes, probably faster.
